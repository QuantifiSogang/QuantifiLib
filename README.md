## QuantifiLib

QuantifiLib is a research-oriented Python library for quantitative finance, developed by Quantifi Sogang.  
It provides a modular and extensible framework for systematic trading research, including data loading, event-based labeling, signal generation, backtesting, portfolio optimization, time series modeling, causal inference, and synthetic data generation.  

QuantifiLib is designed to serve as a full-stack infrastructure for academic finance research, integrating both traditional econometric models and modern machine learning techniques.

Whether you're building event-driven strategies, training machine learning models with purged cross-validation, or simulating asset prices with GANs, QuantifiLib offers a unified environment to streamline your research process.
